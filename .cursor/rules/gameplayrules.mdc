Use the following to inform logic for gameplay. These rules inform what is allowed logically.

## **Game Setup**  
- **Before playing**, the **Loco cards** should be **separated from the rest of the deck** and **kept with the money**.  
- The **Demand and Event cards** are **shuffled together** to form the **card deck**.  

---

## **Demand Cards**  
Each **Demand card** shows:  
1. **The city needing the good** (e.g., **Berlin**).  
2. **The money payable upon delivery** (e.g., **ECU 7M**).  
   - ECU = **European Currency Units**  
   - M = **Million**  
3. **The three goods in demand** in that city.  

---

## **Event Cards**  
- The deck contains **20 Event cards** that **affect gameplay**.  
- When drawn, **Event cards are placed face up** and **shown to all players**.  
- The **drawing player continues to draw** until they have **3 Demand cards** in their hand.  
- **Every player must always have 3 Demand cards**.  
- **Details on Event card effects** are described on **page 11** of the rulebook.  

---

## **Loco Cards (Train Types & Upgrades)**  
Each player has **1 Loco card**, which shows:  
- **Train type**  
- **Maximum speed (mileposts per turn)**  
- **Load capacity**  

There are **four types of trains**:  
- **Freight** → **Carries 2 loads** | **Moves 9 mileposts per turn**  
- **Fast Freight** → **Carries 2 loads** | **Moves 12 mileposts per turn**  
- **Heavy Freight** → **Carries 3 loads** | **Moves 9 mileposts per turn**  
- **Superfreight** → **Carries 3 loads** | **Moves 12 mileposts per turn**  

### **Train Upgrades**  
- **Each player starts with a Freight train**.  
- **At the end of their turn**, a player **may upgrade instead of building track**.  
- **Upgrade costs**:  
  - **ECU 20M** → Upgrade from **Freight** to **Fast Freight** or **Heavy Freight**.  
  - **ECU 20M** → Upgrade from **Fast Freight** or **Heavy Freight** to **Superfreight**.  

---

## **Load Chips**  
- **Before playing**, the **printed stickers must be applied** to the load chips. *(More details may follow on the next page.)*  

---
## **Load Chips**  
- **Each load chip represents a load** that can be **carried on a player's train**.  
- To **show a load is being carried**, place the **load chip on the player's train**.  
- **Unused loads** are placed in the **plastic tray**, where players can see **which loads are available for pickup**.  
- When a player:  
  - **Delivers a load**  
  - **Drops a load without delivering it**  
  - **Loses a load due to an Event card**  
  - The load is **returned to the plastic tray** with the other available loads.  
- **Load chips are limited** to those provided in the game; additional loads **should not be made**, except as replacements.  
- **Charts showing the number of available loads and their pickup locations** are included in the center of the rulebook.  
- **Circus Load Chips** (for a game variation) are included and must be **set aside** when not playing with the variation.

---

## **Preparation for Play**  
- Players **sit around the board**, and one player acts as **the banker**.  
- The **banker** manages the **money, Loco cards, and available load chips**.  
- Each player starts with:  
  - **ECU 50 million**  
  - **Three Demand cards** (face up)  
  - **One Freight Loco card**  
  - **One pawn and one crayon of the same color**  

### **Determining the First Player**  
- Players **cut the deck** to determine **who moves first**.  
- The player who **draws the card with the highest payoff** goes first (**Event cards count as zero**).  
- The deck is then **reshuffled**, and the dealer **deals three cards face up** to each player.  

### **Handling Event Cards at the Start**  
- Players **discard all Event cards** they receive at the beginning and **draw replacements**.  
- **Event cards are only discarded at the beginning of the game**.  
- Later, if an Event card is drawn, it **must be displayed and takes immediate effect**.  
- The dealer **shuffles discarded Event cards** back into the deck.  

### **Managing the Deck**  
- When the **deck is exhausted**, the dealer **reshuffles the discard pile** to form a **new deck**.  

### **Demand Card Rules**  
- A player must **always have 3 Demand cards**.  
- Whenever a Demand card is **discarded** or an **Event card is drawn**, a **replacement Demand card must be drawn**.  
- If a player has **fewer than 3 Demand cards**, they **must draw a new one immediately**, regardless of whose turn it is.  

---

## **How to Play**  
On a player's turn, they must:  
1. **FIRST**, operate their train by:  
   - Moving  
   - Loading and unloading  
   - Paying track use fees  
   - Collecting payoffs  

---

## **Turn Sequence**  
### **Second Phase of a Turn**  
- A player may **spend up to ECU 20 million per turn** to:  
  1. **Build track**, OR  
  2. **Upgrade their train**.  

### **Discarding Cards Instead of Taking a Turn**  
- A player **may discard their entire hand** and **draw 3 new cards**.  
- Any **Event cards drawn** must be **displayed and replaced immediately**.  
- **Players who lose a turn** due to an Event card **cannot discard their hand during their lost turn**.  

### **Passing Turns**  
- After a player **completes their turn**, the **next player (to the left) takes their turn**.  

---

## **Building Railroads**  
- The **game board starts empty**, with **no track built**.  
- Players **take two turns at the start of the game** to **build track before moving trains**.  
- Each player may spend **up to ECU 20 million** in each of these two building turns.  

### **Order of Play in the First Two Turns**  
1. **First building turn**:  
   - The **first player builds track**.  
   - Play progresses **clockwise** around the table.  
2. **Second building turn**:  
   - The **last player from the first turn builds first**.  
   - Play progresses **counterclockwise**.  

### **After Initial Building Turns**  
- The **last player from the second building turn** becomes the **first player for the rest of the game**.  
- Play continues **clockwise for the remainder of the game**.  

---

## **Planning a Railroad Route**  
- After reviewing their **9 Demand card requirements**, players:  
  1. **Locate the load sources on the board**.  
  2. **Find the corresponding cities where the loads must be delivered**.  
  3. **Plan their railroad route** to connect **pickup locations with delivery cities**.  
  4. **Begin building track**.  

### **How to Build Track**  
- Players **draw a line** from **one milepost to the next**.  
- The player **must pay** the **cost of the milepost** they are building to.  

---

## **Track Building Costs**  

| **Type of Terrain/City** | **Cost (ECU)** |
|--------------------------|--------------|
| **Clear Terrain**        | **1 million** |
| **Mountain**            | **2 million** |
| **Alpine**              | **5 million** |
| **Small City**          | **3 million** |
| **Medium City**         | **3 million** |
| **Major City**          | **5 million** |
| **Ferry Ports**         | **(as specified on the map)** |

### **Additional Costs for Water Crossings**  
| **Type of Water Crossing** | **Additional Cost (ECU)** |
|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| **River**                  | **2 million** |
| **Lake**                   | **3 million** |
| **Ocean Inlet**            | **3 million** |


-------------------
Selling and Trading Track
Instead of building track, a player may purchase track from another player for whatever price both players agree to. The purchase may take place only in the purchasing player's turn. Players can agree to trade track for track, with no money involved.
In both trading and selling, the selling player replaces his colored lines with lines of the new owner's color.

New Loads and Demands
A multitude of new loads were proposed for Empire Builder, from beer (from Milwaukee and Detroit) and electronics (from Austin, TX and Boston) to textiles (from Raleigh).
To create new loads, mark them on the map (using a new color of crayon) and use the blank stickers and cards to make new load chips and Demand cards. Try your hand at it!
Our favorite new one is:
The Circus
At the start of the game, place the Circus load chips in Kaliningrad and Paris, where they will remain until picked up (like field warehousing).
Each Demand card with a number divisible by 10 (e.g., 20, 30, ..., 110, 120) is modified by changing the lowest-payoff demand(s); that demand becomes ECU 20 million to deliver the Circus to that city.
The Demand card then works normally, but when the Circus is delivered to a city, it remains there until picked up and delivered again.
A player may not pick up the Circus unless he has a Demand card for the Circus; however, it may be dropped without payoff at any city, and if it is lost due to a Derailment Event card, it is placed at the nearest city.
Building Across Water
	•	The cost for building across a river (ECU 2 million), a lake (ECU 3 million), or an ocean inlet (ECU 3 million) is in addition to the regular cost for building to a milepost.
	•	Building to a mountain milepost and crossing a river costs ECU 4 million.
	•	Building across more than one river or ocean inlet costs the same as building across one river or inlet.

Track Building Rules
Beginning Construction
	•	A player may start building track from:
		Any major city milepost, OR
		Any milepost already connected to the player's track.
	•	A player cannot build more than 2 track sections from a major city milepost in one turn.
	•	No track may be built within the red area of a major city.

Ferry Ports
	•	Only 2 players may build to (and from) a single ferry line.
	•	The first player to build to a ferry port must pay the full ferry cost.
	•	The other end of the ferry port can be built at no extra cost.
	•	Every player is guaranteed the right to build to at least one English Channel ferry line.
	•	Track building restrictions:
		A second player must always have access to one section of track at each ferry port.
		Dublin costs ECU 8 million to build to, and Belfast costs ECU 4 million (plus ferry costs).

Building into Cities
Right to Enter Major Cities
	•	Every player is entitled to build at least one section of track from every major city.
	•	No player may block another player from having at least one track section from a major city.

Limited Entry into Medium & Small Cities
	•	Medium Cities: Only 3 players may build track into a medium city.
	•	Small Cities: Only 2 players may build track into a small city.
	•	Track Limit:
		No player may build more than 3 track sections to a medium or small city.
		No track may block a third player from entering a medium city.
		No track may block a second player from entering a small city.

Right of Way
	•	Only one track section may be built between any two mileposts.
No Credit / No Loans
	•	A player cannot build more track than he can immediately pay for.
	•	Unpaid track is immediately erased.

Hauling Freight
Earning Money
	•	A player earns money by delivering a load from a city where it can be picked up to a city where it is demanded (as per the Demand card).
Starting the Train
	•	Each player chooses any city to start their train (represented by their pawn).
Running the Train
	•	A player moves his train by traveling on built track and counting mileposts up to the train's maximum movement per turn.
	•	Train movement limits:
		Freights & Heavy Freights: 9 mileposts per turn
		Fast Freights & Superfreights: 12 mileposts per turn
	•	No limit to how many trains can:
		End their turn on the same milepost.
		Use the same track.
	•	Trains cannot block each other—they may pass freely.


## **Train Movement Rules**  
- **Trains may pass each other** on the same track.  
- A train **may only reverse direction at a city**, including:  
  - **Major city mileposts**  
  - **Ferry port mileposts**  

### **Major City Travel Rules**  
- **All players’ tracks are connected across major cities** by the **red area**, representing the **local rail system**.  
- Trains **may travel across cities** (including **rivers**) using the **red area** as their **own track**.  
- **Loads may be picked up or delivered** at **any major city milepost**.  
- The **center milepost in a major city** is treated as a **milepost for movement**.  

### **Using Ferries**  
- To use a **ferry**, the player must:  
  1. Move to the **ferry port** and **stop movement** for that turn.  
  2. On the next turn, **start counting from the opposite ferry port** and move at **half rate**.  
  3. If **not using** the ferry, a **ferry port milepost** is treated **as a clear milepost**.  

### **Track Usage Costs**  
- A **player pays nothing** to run on **his own track**.  
- To **use an opponent’s track**, a player must pay **ECU 4 million per turn** to each opponent whose track is used.  
- A player **cannot use an opponent’s track** unless they have **enough cash to pay** before moving onto it.  

---

## **Picking Up Loads**  
- A **train may pick up a load** by **passing through a city** where that load is available.  
- **Load limits per train type**:  
  - **Freight & Fast Freight**: **Up to 2 loads**  
  - **Heavy Freight & Superfreight**: **Up to 3 loads**  
- **Players may carry different types of loads** and can pick up loads even **if they do not have a Demand card for them**.  
- **Dropping loads**:  
  - A player **may drop a load** at **any city without a payoff**.  
- **Picking up or unloading a load does not reduce movement**—the player may continue moving at full allowance.  
- **Players may load, unload, and move** in any order within their movement allowance, following train type, ferry use, and Event card restrictions.  

---

## **Delivering Loads**  
- When a player **delivers a load** to a **city with a Demand card for that load**, they must:  
  1. **Discard the Demand card** (Only **one** load per Demand card).  
  2. **Receive the payoff** amount from the **bank**.  
  3. **Return the load chip** to the available **load tray**.  
  4. **Draw a new Demand card**.  
  5. **Continue their turn**, which may include:  
     - Delivering **another load**  
     - Dropping a load  
     - Picking up a load  
     - Moving until their **movement allowance is used up**  

- After finishing movement, the player may **spend up to ECU 20 million** to:  
  - **Build additional track**  
  - **Upgrade their train**  

---

Fulfilling Demand Cards
	•	A load must be delivered to fulfill a Demand card.
	•	Only when the demand is fulfilled may the Demand card be discarded.
	•	Dropping Loads:
		Any load may be dropped at any city.
		If the load is available in that city, it is returned to the tray.
		If not available, the load remains in that city.
		If there is already a load at the city, the first load is returned to the tray, and the newly dropped load remains.

Load Management
	•	A load may be dropped at any city.
	•	If the load is available in that city, it is returned to the tray.
	•	If the load is not available, it remains in that city.
	•	If there is already a load at the city, the first load is returned to the tray, and the newly dropped load remains.

Mercy Rules (For Beginners or Trapped Players)
Sometimes, a player may become trapped and unable to build or move. If discarding cards does not help, try these rules:
Borrowing
	•	A player may borrow up to ECU 20 million from the bank.
	•	The borrowed amount can be used immediately for building track or paying track use fees.
	•	The player must pay back double the borrowed amount from all delivery payoffs until fully repaid.
Late Payment of Use Fees
	•	A player may use another player’s track and pay the track usage fee later using money from delivery payoffs.
Backtracking
	•	A train may reverse direction at any milepost (not just a city milepost).
	•	Backtracking costs 1 full turn.
	•	The train may move in any direction on the next turn.
	•	Restrictions:
		A train may not backtrack if the player has discarded Demand cards in the same turn.
		A train may backtrack if unable to move due to Derailment or Rail Strike.
		If backtracking on another player’s track, the usage fee still applies.
Restart (Completely Resetting a Player's Position)
A player may completely restart their game by following these steps:
	1	At the beginning of their turn, the player declares a restart.
	2	The player discards all Demand cards, returns their Loco card to the bank, returns loads to the tray, erases their track, and returns all money to the bank.
	3	Other players may protect some of the restarting player's track to preserve routes they are using. Protected track remains in the game.
	4	The player receives:
		A Freight Loco card.
		ECU 50 million.
		3 new Demand cards.
		Any Event cards drawn take effect normally.
	5	The player may build up to ECU 20 million on their restart turn.
	6	The player restarts their train at any city at the beginning of their turn.

		Event Card Effects
		An Event card takes effect immediately when drawn.
		Most Event cards remain in effect until the end of the drawing player's next turn, after which they are discarded.
		The Derailment and Excess Profit Tax cards take effect once and are immediately discarded.
		Players must obey the directions on the Event card while it is in effect.
		For further details, refer to the Event Card Explanation Chart at the end of the rulebook.
		
		Counting Mileposts
		Mileposts are counted the same way as train movement.
		To count mileposts from a major city, start counting from the city center, not the outer mileposts.
		To count mileposts from a seacoast, start counting from the milepost closest to the seacoast.
		Regional boundaries for the Atlantic Ocean:
		Atlantic & Irish Sea boundary: The southeasternmost milepost of Ireland.
		Atlantic & English Channel boundary: The northwesternmost milepost of France and the southwesternmost milepost of England.
		Atlantic & Mediterranean boundary: The milepost directly south of Sevilla.
		
		Half Rate Movement
		When trains move at half rate:
		Freights & Heavy Freights move 5 mileposts per turn.
		Fast Freights & Superfreights move 6 mileposts per turn.
		If an Event card causes a train that has already moved to switch to half rate, or if a train enters an area of bad weather, the remaining movement is halved (rounding fractions up).
		
		Flood Events
		When a Flood Event occurs:
		Bridges crossing the affected river are immediately erased.
		The track may be rebuilt, but only after the Flood Event card is discarded at the end of the drawing player's next turn.
		Rebuilt bridges cost the same as the original track-building cost (ECU 2 million plus the cost of the milepost).
		Bridges in major cities (within the red area) are closed only while the Flood Event card is in effect.
		
		Derailments
		When a Derailment Event occurs:
		Only trains in the affected area at the moment the card is drawn are impacted.
		Trains may enter the area immediately after without penalty.
		
		Lost Loads
		When a train loses a load, the player operating the train chooses which load is lost from those currently being carried.
		The Event card does not affect any loads picked up after it is drawn.


## **How to Win**  
- The winner is the **first player** whose **continuous line of track connects seven major cities** **and** who has **ECU 250 million in cash**.  
- **Only cash counts**—money spent on building railroads **does not count toward winning**.  

---

## **Courtesy in Play**  
- A player's **Demand and Loco cards** (along with the **load chips on the Loco card**) must be **face up** for all players to see.  
- A player **does not need to show their money** until the **Excess Profit Tax Event card** appears.  
- After that, a player's money **becomes public information**.  

---

## **Variations**  
Since the release of **Empire Builder**, the game on which **Eurorails** is based, thousands of players have created **house rules** to enhance gameplay.  

The following **play variations** are some of the best suggestions received.  

**Note:** Some of these rules **radically alter** the game. **All players must agree** to a variation **before the game begins**.  

---

### **Fast Game (For Quicker Play)**  
To speed up the game, use any or all of these rule changes:  
- **Players start with ECU 70 million** and get **3 pre-movement turns**.  
- **Discard all Event cards** dealt at the start—**do not shuffle them back into the deck**.  
- **Train movement speed increases**:  
  - **Freights & Heavy Freights**: **12 mileposts per turn**  
  - **Fast Freights & Superfreights**: **16 mileposts per turn**  
  - **Half rate movement**: **6 and 8 mileposts per turn**, respectively.  
- The **Excess Profit Tax Event card** has **no effect** and is **immediately discarded**.  
- The **first player to reach ECU 250 million wins**, regardless of city connections.  

---

### **Sudden Death Variant**  
- The game **lasts until the last card in the deck is drawn**.  
- The game **ends at the end of that player's move**.  
- The **player with the most money wins**.  
- A player **may not discard their entire hand** if **fewer than 12 cards remain in the deck**.  
- **Fast Game rules are recommended** for beginners and younger players.  

---

### **Honeymoon Game: Eurorails for Two (2-Player Variant)**  
- **Reduce the number of available load chips** by **1 per commodity** (e.g., only **3 loads of Oil** instead of 4).  
- **City entry restrictions**:  
  - **Medium cities**: **Only 2 players** may build track.  
  - **Small cities**: **Only 1 player** may build track.  
- **To build into a small city**, the player **must have a Demand card** for:  
  - **That city** OR  
  - **A commodity available in that city**.  
- Once the player **builds into the small city**, that **demand must be fulfilled**.  

---


### **Example Delivery: Card #31 - Cheese from København to Szczecin (ECU 12M)**  
1. The player **starts at København (A)** and **picks up cheese**.  
2. They move their train **onto the ferry port (B)** and **end movement for that turn**.  
3. On the **next turn**, they **cross the ferry** and move **3 mileposts** to **Szczecin**.  
4. The player then:  
   - **Discards Demand card #31**.  
   - **Returns the load chip (cheese) to the tray**.  
   - **Collects ECU 12M from the bank**.  
5. The player still has **1 milepost left**, so they **move southward** and **end at (C)**.

## **Challenge Game (For Experienced Players)**  
To make the game **more challenging**, use any or all of the following rule changes:  

### **Slow Start**  
- Players **start with ECU 30 million** and a **Slow Freight**.  
- **Slow Freight stats**:  
  - **Moves up to 6 mileposts per turn**  
  - **Carries up to 2 loads**  
- Players may **upgrade the Slow Freight to a regular Freight** by paying **ECU 20 million**.  
- **Upgrades proceed normally afterward**.  

### **Limited City Access**

  - A player may **only build 1 track section from a major city milepost per turn**.  
  - A player may have **only 2 track sections connecting to a small or medium city**.  

### **Field Warehousing**  
- **Loads dropped off in a city without a payoff remain there for 4 turns**.  
- During those **4 turns**, **any player** may pick up the load by **passing through the city**.  
- After the **dropping player's fourth turn**, the **load is returned to the tray**.  

### **Open Contracts**  
- When a **player discards their hand**, their **discarded Demand cards** are **placed on the board instead of the discard pile**.  
- These cards become **open contracts available to all players**.  
- The **first player to deliver a load on an open contract**:  
  - **Picks up the card from the table**  
  - **Discards it after delivery**  
  - **Receives the standard payoff**  
- **Only 4 open contracts may be active** at a time—any extra cards are immediately discarded.  

### **Reshuffle Rule**

- When the **Reshuffle card is drawn**, the **deck is reshuffled**.  

### **Cost to Move**  
- **Each player must pay ECU 1 million per turn for moving their train on their own track**.  
- The **ECU 4 million cost for using an opponent’s track remains unchanged**.  

### **Cost to Load**  
- **Each time a player picks up or drops off a load**, they **use 1 milepost of movement**.  
- Example:  
  - **Picking up 2 loads** → Uses **2 mileposts of movement**.  
  - **Picking up 1 load and dropping off 1 load** → Uses **2 mileposts of movement**.  

### **Additional Trains**  
- **Each player starts with 2 trains**:  
  - **A Freight**  
  - **A Fast Freight**  
- Both trains **may move during the same turn**.
