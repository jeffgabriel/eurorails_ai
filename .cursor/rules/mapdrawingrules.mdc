When drawing a map from configuration, the configured coordinates are in global space and must be converted. We will use the following constants:

min_x ≈ 45.836 — the smallest X coordinate (leftmost column)

min_y ≈ 325.591 — the smallest Y coordinate (topmost row)

avg_dx ≈ 208.421 — average horizontal spacing between columns

avg_dy ≈ 114.367 — average vertical spacing between rows

In order to calculate local space (rows and columms) we'll use the following function where x and y are the values from the configuration file:

def to_local_grid(x, y):
    col = round((x - min_x) / avg_dx)
    row = round((y - min_y) / avg_dy)
    return col, row
