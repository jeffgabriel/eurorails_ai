- the github repo is jeffgabriel/eurorails_ai
- all of our local branches take the form of jeff/[NAME OF BRANCH]
- we always create a local branch if we're on main, do no branching if already on a branch
- we first commit to the local branch when asked to commit.
- we setup branches to track local by using the -u flag when pushing a local branch to remote.
- write a summary message, and identify the issue to resolve when creating a PR
