# Game Creation from Lobby - Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the step-by-step plan to implement game creation functionality from the lobby in the EuroRails AI project. The goal is to allow users to create games, generate unique join codes, invite players, and start games from the lobby interface.

## Project Structure
- **Total Issues**: 6 GitHub issues (#64, #66-#70)
- **Estimated Total Effort**: 20-26 hours
- **Actual Effort So Far**: ~19 hours
- **Completed Issues**: 5 out of 6 (Issues #63, #66-#70)
- **Dependencies**: Sequential implementation (each task depends on the previous)

## 🎯 Current Status
- ⏳ **Phase 0**: User Authentication Foundation - PENDING (Issue #64)
- ✅ **Phase 1**: Database Foundation - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Phase 2**: Backend Service Layer - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Phase 3**: API Routes - COMPLETED (implemented in Phase 2)
- ✅ **Phase 4**: Frontend Integration - COMPLETED
- ✅ **Phase 5**: Testing & Validation - COMPLETED

**Latest**: All lobby functionality complete and production-ready with comprehensive testing

## 📝 **Issue #64 Status**
**Current Implementation**: Uses simple `user_id` UUIDs without authentication table
**Issue #64 Requirements**: Full user authentication with users table, passwords, and JWT tokens
**Decision**: Phase 0 (Issue #64) can be implemented later as it doesn't block current lobby functionality

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 0: User Authentication Foundation (Issue #64) ⏳ PENDING
**Estimated Effort**: 4-5 hours
**Dependencies**: None
**Status**: Partially implemented (missing users table)

#### Tasks
1. Create users table with authentication fields:
   - `id` (UUID PRIMARY KEY)
   - `username` (VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL)
   - `email` (VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL)
   - `password_hash` (VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL)
   - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
   - `last_active` (TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)
2. Update games table to reference users:
   - `created_by_user_id` (UUID REFERENCES users(id))
3. Update players table to reference users:
   - `user_id` (UUID REFERENCES users(id)) - Already implemented
4. Create authentication endpoints:
   - `POST /auth/register` - User registration
   - `POST /auth/login` - User login
   - `GET /auth/me` - Get current user
5. Add password hashing and JWT tokens
6. Update lobby service to work with user authentication

#### Checkpoints
- [ ] Users table created
- [ ] Authentication endpoints implemented
- [ ] Password hashing working
- [ ] JWT token system implemented
- [ ] Lobby service updated for user auth
- [ ] All tests passing with authentication

### Phase 1: Database Foundation (Issue #66)
**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 hours
**Dependencies**: None

#### Tasks
1. Create migration script `011_add_lobby_fields.sql`
2. Add lobby-specific fields to games table:
   - `join_code` (VARCHAR(8), unique)
   - `created_by` (UUID, references players.id)
   - `is_public` (BOOLEAN, default false)
   - `lobby_status` (TEXT, check constraint)
3. Add user management fields to players table:
   - `user_id` (UUID)
   - `is_online` (BOOLEAN, default true)
4. Create performance indexes

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema Changes

#### Current Implementation (Phase 1-3)
```sql
-- Games table additions
ALTER TABLE games 
ADD COLUMN join_code VARCHAR(8) UNIQUE,
ADD COLUMN created_by UUID REFERENCES players(id),
ADD COLUMN is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT false,
ADD COLUMN lobby_status TEXT CHECK (lobby_status IN ('IN_SETUP', 'ACTIVE', 'COMPLETE')) DEFAULT 'IN_SETUP';

-- Players table additions
ALTER TABLE players 
ADD COLUMN user_id UUID,
ADD COLUMN is_online BOOLEAN DEFAULT true;
```

#### Future Implementation (Phase 0 - Issue #64)
```sql
-- Users table for authentication
CREATE TABLE users (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    last_active TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Update games table to reference users
ALTER TABLE games 
ADD COLUMN created_by_user_id UUID REFERENCES users(id);

-- Players table already has user_id (implemented in Phase 1)
```

### Service Layer Structure
```
LobbyService
├── createGame(data: CreateGameData)
├── joinGame(joinCode: string, userId: string)
├── getGame(gameId: string)
├── getGamePlayers(gameId: string)
├── startGame(gameId: string, creatorUserId: string)
├── leaveGame(gameId: string, userId: string)
└── updatePlayerPresence(userId: string, isOnline: boolean)
```

### API Endpoint Structure
```
/api/lobby/
├── POST /games              # Create game
├── POST /games/join         # Join game
├── GET  /games/:id          # Get game info
├── GET  /games/:id/players  # Get game players
├── POST /games/:id/start    # Start game
└── POST /games/:id/leave    # Leave game
```

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **Database Migration Issues**
   - Mitigation: Test migrations in clean environment
   - Rollback plan: Keep backup of original schema

2. **Concurrent Game Creation**
   - Mitigation: Implement proper locking and unique constraints
   - Testing: Load test with multiple simultaneous requests

3. **API Performance**
   - Mitigation: Add proper indexing and query optimization
   - Monitoring: Add performance metrics and logging

### Business Logic Risks
1. **Join Code Collisions**
   - Mitigation: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Fallback: Use longer codes if needed

2. **Game State Consistency**
   - Mitigation: Use database transactions for multi-step operations
   - Validation: Add comprehensive state validation

## Success Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] Users can create games from lobby
- [ ] Unique join codes are generated
- [ ] Players can join games using join codes
- [ ] Game creator can start game when ready
- [ ] Players can leave games
